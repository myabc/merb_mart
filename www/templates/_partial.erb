A partial has access to the page from which it was called. The title below will be the title of the page in which this partial is rendered.

<%%= h(@page.title) %>

A partial does not have access to it's own meta-data. The partial meta-data is used primarily for finding partials or for use in other pages. The filter(s) specified in the meta-data will be applied to the partial text when it is rendered.

A partial does not require meta-data at all. They can contain just text.
