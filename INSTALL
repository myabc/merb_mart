 merb_mart dm_0_9_0 branch is being built around the cutting-edge Merb
 framework, and the bleeding edge DataMapper framework. As such, you'll have
 to get yourself setup with those gems before you get the chance to play with 
 merb_mart.

 * datamapper 0.9.0 - 'edge' development
    * do (DataObjects)  : git://github.com/sam/do.git
    * dm-core           : git://github.com/sam/dm-core.git

        ** you will need myabc's dm_0_9_0 branch of merb-plugins
           which contains some changes to work nicely with the 
           dm-core and dm-more edge:
