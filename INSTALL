Installation
============

Instructions for installation:

file: config/init.rb

# add the slice as a regular dependency

dependency 'merb_mart'

# if needed, configure which slices to load and in which order

Merb::Plugins.config[:merb_slices] = { :queue => ["MerbMart", ...] }

# optionally configure the plugins in a before_app_loads callback

Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
  
  Merb::Slices::config[:merb_E_mart] = { ... }
  
end

file: config/router.rb

# example: /merb_mart/:controller/:action/:id

r.add_slice(:MerbMart)

# example: /foo/:controller/:action/:id

r.add_slice(:MerbMart, 'foo') # same as :path => 'foo'

# example: /:lang/:controller/:action/:id (with :a param set)

r.add_slice(:MerbMart, :path => ':lang', :params => { :a => 'b' })

# example: /:controller/:action/:id

r.slice(:MerbMart)

Normally you should also run the following rake task:

rake slices:merb_E_mart:install

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can put your application-level overrides in:

host-app/slices/merb_mart/app - controllers, models, views ...

Templates are located in this order:

1. host-app/slices/merb_mart/app/views/*
2. gems/merb_mart/app/views/*
3. host-app/app/views/*

You can use the host application's layout by configuring the
merb_mart slice in a before_app_loads block:

Merb::Slices.config[:merb_E_mart] = { :layout => :application }

By default :merb_E_mart is used. If you need to override
stylesheets or javascripts, just specify your own files in your layout
instead/in addition to the ones supplied (if any) in 
host-app/public/slices/merb_mart.

In any case don't edit those files directly as they may be clobbered any time
rake merb_E_mart:install is run.
 
Dependencies
------------
